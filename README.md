# Unique Fractions

Based on a Reddit post: [Unique Fractions between 0 and 1 visualized -- Angle = Value of fraction, Radius = Denominator.](https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/8j5vjx/oc_ver_2_unique_fractions_between_0_and_1/).

Plot unique fractions between 0 and 1 on a polar plot.

```
θ = 2π*fraction
r = denominator
```

See [Unique Fractions.ipynb](Unique Fractions.ipynb) for calculation and plots.
